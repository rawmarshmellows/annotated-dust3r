# Important rules you HAVE TO FOLLOW
- Always add debug and comments in the code for easier debugging and readability
- Everytime to choose to apply a rule(s), explicity state the rule{s} in the output. You can abbreviate the rule to a single word or phrase
- Before doing the refactoring, break it down step by step. Then validate each checkpoint with tests
